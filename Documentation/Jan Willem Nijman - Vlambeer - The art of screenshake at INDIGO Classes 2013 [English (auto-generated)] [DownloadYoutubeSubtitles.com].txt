welcome

back um it's a great pleasure to

announce here JW yon willum from vamir

who's uh we talked about game field he

said that was a terrible term so we

almost got into a fight about that so I

said well you want to talk about

whatever that is that we can't call

gamefuel and he said yeah I'll will so

you're going to destroy the term and uh

I said that's okay but he's going to at

least uh talk about how to make the

games feel good and uh a warm Applause

for Yan Willam from

vumbia hello um all right let's do this

so I'm y n I'm 50% of Indie studio

flamber and I am responsible for game

design and execution whatever that means

uh and this talk is about game f with a

lot of those things I don't know how you

call those in English um this is our

logo uh it's a flaming

bear and we made a lot of video games uh

this is a video game called Ridiculous

Fishing uh which you'll hear more about

tonight uh and I'm not talking about the

awards because that would be silly um

and this is a game called Super Crate

Box which you can download uh for free

also on Steam uh this is a game called

gun Gods which you can also download for

free it's like a first person shooter

about gangster rap on Venus uh but

nobody played it but it's actually not

that bad um this is like a really badly

cropped screenshot of an upcoming game

called Loof risers about airplanes

shooting each other uh yeah pretty much

and this is a game we're working on

right now called Nuclear Throne which is

like a post-apocalyptic Rog like about

mutants growing new Limbs and shooting

monsters and all that kind of

stuff all

right so let me start with this I don't

have that much to say about gamefuel I'm

not a academic I'm more of a person who

comes up with things and then makes them

talking is kind of hard um you know I

like tweeting that's easier shorter um

so I'm not going to go too much into

Theory here I'm not a psychologist I

don't understand all that stuff but I

have made a lot of games and I found out

some small little tricks through that

um let's start by getting some

water

um all

right so there are some people uh who

have great things to say about this

subject uh actually there's Martin

jonison and patri per who are actually

giving a talk uh here today and they're

right there and I didn't know they were

giving it so I'm basically doing the

same thing so if you want to not be

spoiled you should walk away right now

because their talk is probably

better uh and Cactus or Jonathan s time

uh gave a great talk at IGS in 2009

about how making games is like making

babies but uh it also had some really

good tips on making games feel good um

that stupid word feel like it's a super

abstract thing and it's different for

every player but you still have to work

with

it so um I present to you a video game

um but this really sucks like this is

just a computer with some [ __ ] on it and

nothing's happening um you know games

aren't really games unless you have

something else which makes it a lot more

complicated suddenly which is called a

player um and the worst thing about

players is that there's so many of them

and they're all different

and that makes making games very

complicated like a game will be

different for every single person

playing them once again I don't

understand these things actually I'm

just saying what I think makes sense and

it probably doesn't make sense but it

works for us so let me explain how games

work and it's very

complicated so you have this game and a

player then the game goes into the

player's head through like basically

visuals and sound don't have smell games

yet

uh and then the player's like oh yeah I

see these things let me put some push

some buttons and then the player puts

his input back into the game and then

the game's like all right I am going to

change for you look see it actually

changes bam and and the changes go back

into the player and then the player is

like ooh this has me thinking and now

the game has meaning um and that's

actually where the value comes in like

people can change their lives learn

something become a better person because

they press those buttons in the game set

hey this changed uh and that's why games

are interesting at least to me and this

is probably all wrong but once again

that doesn't matter because it works for

us and then those thoughts go back

through the player into the game and the

meaning becomes game play and all that

stuff um but this is

cooler um so with flamb beer we're

basically good at just one thing with

making games and that's like this part

which is after the game goes into the

player and then the player puts input

into the game the game goes back into

the player that's like like I press a

button and a bullet flies and the bullet

hits something that's that blue arrow

there um and we make that feel good and

that's why they asked us to give a talk

about game view um I also put an extra

slide in here so I can like animate this

so it's kind of more

exciting um so this whole model is kind

of interesting because you can put many

games into those arrows and kind of

figure out which parts they focus on

like you have some uh games that cover

lots of meaningful subjects and they're

all about that little green arrow going

into that those thoughts um and you have

uh Triple A games who only do like the

first thing and pour that game into a

player and player doesn't really do much

um that makes me sad um all right enough

talking

about game feel how do you call those

things like the hyphens or quotation

on cool lots of quotation marks so I'm

just going to scratch that name and then

I think on the the menu of the

conference not the menu how do you call

that thing whatever the schedule uh this

talk is called the art of screen Shake

um which is also a bit silly so I'm just

going to cut all the talk crap and just

teach you guys some tricks I learned

while making games so this talk is now

officially called 30 tiny tricks that

will make your action game better um

which is something I can actually talk

about um because I might not be an

academic or a psychologist I make action

games um and I'm proud of

it let's

go so we have here a super shitty

platform shooter like average stuff

anybody could make this crap I'm sorry

um but seriously anybody could sit down

with some tutorials and get some

shooting in there

and you know you have a game uh cactus

in his IG talk in 2009 which I talked

about um a couple of minutes ago showed

this with like a Mario clone and it's

like oh you have to jump on their heads

many times before you die and it was

really funny so I just stole it um so

basically this game really sucks

because you know not much is really

happening

that I have to fill an hour so is fine

oh I killed one yay so um the end thank

you no I'm kidding

um so now I'm just going to put those 30

tiny tricks in there to make this game

better um so the first one is I

don't basic animations and sound like

I made those suns in sfxr which

everybody uses I can now jump and my

hair moves like that's me I'm actually

wearing that sweater today and I can

like shoot more and woo walking

animation so now the game like the sound

just makes the shooting feel much better

that stuff is super

important all right um so let's start

fixing that shitty gameplay with enemies

with too much health so lower enemy

HP kind of yay now like this is such a

silly tiny um change but if I would have

shown you the first game uh instead of

this one you would have totally thought

it was a shitty game um but this is not

that bad like this is starting to get

somewhere everybody can kind of figure

this out like enemy HP make it lower

it's more fun um and then also make your

rate of fire higher because it's even

more fun because it's a [ __ ] video

game about shooting things you might as

well put a lot of shooting in there

because it's my only way to communicate

with this sad World um and now that we

have this you might as well put more

enemies in there because you get to

shoot more things and it's basically the

same as having one enemy with a lot of

Health I'm just putting six in there

with a little bit of Health it just like

those tiny differences might not mean

much for game play actually they do but

you can pretend they don't like numbers

wise but it it feels better like let's

do that again yeah get some see not now

I'm like this game feels better I think

um all right bigger bullets uh that's

also important see like that's like a

beginner mistake in video games people

make these tiny dots for bullets because

in real life the bullet is

Tiny doesn't really make a lot of sense

like bullets in video games should be at

least like the size of of your chest or

something um but this is still kind of

weird you know so let's make him like at

a little muzzle flesh this is like the

Cheap Trick we always use in flamer

games it's just the first frame of your

bullet Sprite just make it a

circle hey muzzle

flesh that's what all the first person

shooters have

um and fostter bullets because that just

feels way better

right so now now we're talking like this

is not a a really shitty game anymore it

has big bullets that move fast and a

little muzzle flash um I don't know what

did I put in after this um less accuracy

because it looks more

fun and it actually influences gameplay

a little bit like but that that I don't

know I just felt at this point while

programming the presentation that was a

good thing to add and it makes it less

boring to watch it and this is pretty

much all there is to watch it with this

game it's all about shooting you know

it's a Mindless stupid game so make it

look different every single

time and impact effects like see that

little thing playing when I hit a wall

or an

enemy that

makes like bullets stop disappearing

it's like hey something hit here uh and

it's like not a lot of work you can all

add this in in no time at least I can uh

and a little animation when enemies get

hit because like that that red arrow

going back into the player's head that

like that I showed earlier that's all

like feedback like you communicate the

changes the player put into the game and

you know now I see hey this enem is

getting damaged

um and it's just like a white flesh and

and a slightly different bows and I

think their phases disappear which is

kind of

weird um what's

next enemy knockback oh that's another

one of those things that actually can uh

like nobody really notices it but it can

kind of influence gameplay even like you

see how that guy actually fell to the

right now I have a dynamic combat

situation like they're they're flanking

me and basically all I did was move them

back a couple pixels when they get hit

um because like that's what happens when

you get shot in real life

too

um permanence this is something super

important like why leave the [ __ ]

battle empty after it's over like now

I'm here sending hey look I killed 1 two

three four five six seven dudes there

was combat here and like if I return

here later from this great Corridor of

level design I can see oh I already went

to this place I have to go back um or

whatever um that's something that's

super important to us like to put some

kind of sense of previous combat in our

games like not just leave it empty and

and computers are super good nowadays

right you could just put a million

corpses in there and your computer would

be like oh they don't have to disappear

like that stuff is fine nowadays and let

me just move all the way back to nuclear

drone like you see two magots down there

that are still alive but most of it is

just rubble and dead things and it

doesn't do anything to the game but it

just shows you yeah you're

a basically a guy made out of muscles

and you shoot things um and that's also

why in movies shootouts in bars are so

good because every bullet that misses

actually hits a bottle um that kind of

stuff is important like all the props in

Nuclear Throne in this game they with

like cacti and stuff sing in that

they're just there not to influence

anything but when you miss a shot

something actually happens um now I have

to move all the way back to where we

were um but that that sense of

permanence is really

important

um camera lurp like a lurp is something

that I think it means linear

interpolation yeah I got it right um so

now the camera just slightly lags behind

the player and kind of smoothes in I

don't know if you even notice but it

feels better to move around like this

stuff and this

stuff like you that's the thing about

game Fu those are the little details

that you don't really notice but you

feel Ito um but this camera still sucks

like camera work is important the game

is not here to show you the player

because this game is not about the

player this game is about shooting

things and you're shooting things in

front of you so we might as well do this

and like move the camera around a bit um

and show show you what's happening a bit

more tiny thing but it's important like

this camera works so much better than

this little thing and it's just two

steps in my

presentation

um yeah in Loof trousers uh a game

that's coming out sometime in

2017 uh like the camera is super Dynamic

um and it doesn't only follow the player

it also like mooves slightly head where

you're aiming when you're nearing the

water the the camera kind of moves down

and says hey there's water here and all

the bullets are kind of put into this

big bow of mathematics and it calculates

like the center point of all the bullets

and the camera slightly shifts there so

when you're flying you don't really see

that stuff but it's like hey is the

camera slightly moving this way or I

better Dodge and you dodge and then a

bullet flies from off screen and you

don't die and it feels super good um and

it's it's like just spend a lot of time

on that stuff it's really important so

what's next screen shake so this is

something that kind of became a a thing

vamir is known for or something but

that's just because it's like when

someone shows you a game and they ask

how to improve it usually the answer is

a add some screen Shake because nobody

does it and it's super easy and it makes

your game better like see how it's

shaking just a little bit this guy feels

good like he's just shooting and stuff's

happening like this guy is sad this guy

is happy and especially when you shoot

stuff like yeah

yeah see game f that's what what we're

talking about um play your knockback as

well that's also one of those

things now it's also a gameplay mechanic

like I don't have to walk I could play

the game just shooting which means more

use out of my primary way to interact

with the world but also when moving

forward I'm moving slower when I'm

shooting so maybe I should stop shooting

um

if you put a button in a game like a

firing button give someone a reason to

not press it uh even if it's something

tiny like this

knockback um otherwise you might as well

remove the firing button and just have a

game that automatically fires

always uh yeah that's and you get

dangerous situations like this with a

bit of lava and I'm like oh no I have to

fire a bullet no and I can float in

midair uh and then I die that's

cool sleep so this is little command

which basically passes the game for a

couple of milliseconds you could just

code it yourself I use Game maker and

it's called sleep I don't know anything

about programming really um but what it

does it it just pauses the game for a

couple of milliseconds and I use that in

moments of impact so when I hit an enemy

it will pause for 20 milliseconds or

something and your brain won't notice

that but kind of use that time to

process what's happening a bit more so

all the moments that I want to have

impact your brain is like oh yeah I

remember that more because it took

longer but you don't notice and I don't

understand how brains work but I don't

know that's my theory so nobody really

notices it but like I put some tiny

sleeves in there when you hit a PL enemy

and um also when they die and the

difference between

this and this it's like tiny but it it

like you you can feel that stuff and

that's why I uploaded that presentation

even though nobody here is playing it

right now I don't know why probably

because you don't have oh good one

person um but like when you're playing

it two persons yes very good when you

three three people awesome um good

people when you're when you're playing

it like that you actually feel the

difference um and that's kind of what

fuel is about you can't like this is

really stupid why is everybody watching

it why why isn't everybody standing

behind my computer pressing buttons like

that would be way better next year we'll

have 200 keyboards here for everybody

under your

chair um gun delay this is just kind of

a bug that looked cool like my gun is

now lagging behind me so I put it in the

game look like he's carrying

it and now the gun also kicks back like

boom boom

feels more powerful like tiny little

detail and it makes your game better uh

strafing I just at this point while I

was cutting this presentation I was like

hey it feels kind of cool if I can just

kind of walk backwards while shooting

and

then if I flip it changes that way and

that's also a reason to not press the

the firing button which is good even if

it's just like half a second so I can

turn around but that's that's strategy

um more permanence oh yeah I put little

shells in and they stay forever because

computers nowadays can handle shells

that stay forever they don't have to

disappear after all I could just do this

all day just cover the

floor and then later when I'm walking

back here from defeating some boss or

something like oh yeah I shot a lot of

bullets there that was fun and I can

actually count how many bullets I shot

um to check if the achievements were

correct or whatever

um if you're patri you could also add

like physics to the shells and they pile

up that would would be cool and you can

like swim in the

shells someone make that game please

Petri

[Music]

because now there's not much use just

standing here they just end up in the

same spots so I or whatever um more Bas

in the sign effect

effect so this is a funny little story

um

man um I I was talking to uh a guy who

is like senior designer at BioWare now

but he used to work at Raven software M

here he's super cool and he told me that

one time while I was working on some

firstperson shooter they had a gun and

it wasn't very popular and the investors

were like oh man that gun sucks you

should go and fix it like the game play

is bad and he went to his computer he

opened ad desity or something opened the

gunshot sound effect and click like bass

boost 12 dibs and put it back in the

game and he's like all right I fixed the

game play handed the computer to the

investors and they were like oh yeah

that feels good and that stuff is still

in that video game I I think it was like

the the Wolfenstein reboot not the

recent one but the one before that and

it's like one of the most popular game

guns in that game like add more Bas to

your sound effects it's easy and listen

to that and listen to this who wants to

play this raise your hands

see who wants to play this like a couple

of people

see oh and then you can make your

machine gun shoot like this because it's

a video game and that's easy to program

once you have those bullets and the

accuracy thing um I forgot to make the

the gun shoot like three shells so just

imagine it's like a special type of ammo

with three things or something but like

this this makes video gamees better in

nuclear trone the first weapon is a

pistol the second weapon we programmed

was a triple machine gun just because we

had a bullet and we could do that you

know if you're making an action game you

might as well make a proper action

game random explosions I don't know this

doesn't have much to do with gamefield

but I figured I could add like a a 33%

chance all the enemies exploded on death

see and that stuff feels

good even if it makes no sense

oh now we have faster enemies as well

because I I think the game play was

getting a bit easier because of the

random

explosions so now they're faster and it

feels like more action like if you see

this stuff this is like a proper action

game happening here right that that

looks like something that's kind of

promising

[Music]

yeah look at that gun kick like that

stuff is good right

it's just like free pixels in the art is

really bad but it works um more

enemies because they're faster but we

have random explosions and we might as

well make it look even more like an

action game

I yeah get some I I'm I'm just going to

do this all day and stop talking

now all right

oh even higher rate of fire because now

we have more enemies and we might as

well

like because you can and it's easy you

just change the

value um so that camera kick is

something I wanted to add separately but

I forgot about it so I added it in in

this step of the game so I didn't have

to change all the code what are you

doing so I just have to do

this yeah um so that camera kick is a

little trick I figured out while making

Lu risers instead of just having random

shake it also moves the camera back a

little bit like if you look to the right

you can see this oh that's also my kick

back though but basically my it just

moves the camera in the opposite

direction of the direction I'm shooting

in that stuff also feels good and it's

like a little cheat you can use in your

games um after this talk flamb is out of

business because everybody knows all our

secrets uh so all of our games are

cancelled I don't know ramy's probably

not here so he won't get any at

me

um oh yeah this is the the most

important game design lesson I've had um

back in 2005 or something or four I

wanted to make a shoot him up and I

asked Cactus again uh Jonathan s like

one of the guys who made Hotline Miami

which is a game that's super good at

that permanent stuff by the way like you

kill a lot of people you walk to the

next floor and you kill a lot of more

people and then you walk all the way

back through the Sea of corpses and they

actually use that that in a meaningful

way as well it gets you thinking so they

involve like the the

whole um Fel part of the cycle with the

thinking cycle which is super clever um

anyway he told I asked him how do you

make good arcade games and he told me

make really big explosions uh and I've

been working by that lesson ever since

and look at

this like see now the explosions are

better because they're bigger

[Music]

I don't know why why I started out with

this small explosion but look at this

and the explosions are just like a

circle that that flashes from black to

white and it works I

think so that's game Fu um even more

permanence I think here I added like

simple smoke to the explosions so that

after a battle you can kind of see the

smoke fade away and it's like

yeah and you could take this to an

extreme level like this is just

scratching the surface like you could

add Gibbs and heads flying everywhere

and whatever you want like but just work

on that stuff um but there's one thing

missing from this game which is

like game play because I can interact

with the world but the world does not

really interact with me like they're

just kind of

getting shot it's

horrible almost feel sorry for them so

what this game needs is meaning like

whenever you're making a game make sure

that there's

like the things that you want to happen

are in there don't play it as your game

it's like yeah if you hit an enemy just

press restart that stuff sucks like

don't do that program that game over

State add some meaning to your game

which is what I'm doing right now which

is like step number 40 in making

and it's true I was shooting all this

things that just wanted to like kind of

chill and walk around like I wanted that

to be more dramatic though like let me

just try and kill most of them first

because now I have something to fight

for and there's this last guy he was

meant to kill me like and then I could

could do this and like all I just paed

it but did you see how I just like put

the frame rate at 10 frames per second

because you won't notice on a shitty

Beamer and it looks like I program slow

motion

um just do things like

that and then it speeds up again when I

hit the floor and it says you were the

monster all along it should say that um

yeah and that's basically uh how you

make your game feel better let's compare

this

this to

this I can't even strafe like what kind

of shitty game is that and there's no

meaning I'm

just I want to do this like this is what

what video games should be like they

should have meaning and triple machine

guns at least action

games and this guy could be there to to

put a message out to the masses and

that's pretty much all I have to say on

game feel like just fill your games with

love and Tiny details and are there any

applauses or

[Music]

questions thank you young Willam that's

great um anybody from the room questions

yeah

shot

hi hello uh I want to know what's your

view on uh balancing the game like how

many enemies how many ammo how long the

level takes

um yeah about balancing your game like

how many enemies how many how much ammo

um that totally depends on your game

like with Super Crate bux we tried

making a game that didn't even need ammo

so we put boxes everywhere that change a

weapon and that's the only way to

progress through the game um so that

game was automatically balanced and we

didn't have to balance the weapons

because you had to pick them up anyway

and they're all super

unbalanced um I don't know like it

really depends on your game and you have

to kind of trust your initial gut

feeling and then stop playing your game

yourself because you're the worst play

tester in the world because you just are

too close to your game and there are way

more other people than there are you um

so just get those other people and have

them play your game and work with that

just keep

iterating that's my answer I guess cuz

that's an important point because I

guess what you're saying is when is it

too much like that there was you started

with something that wasn't enough and

you've added stuff and added stuff and

added stuff so when is it enough when is

it too much too much actually we had to

put like an option in nuclear drone to

disable the screen Shake because some

people were getting really nauseous okay

and I guess like a warning with screen

Shake is that it gets kind of addictive

and you get used to it and you put a ton

of it in your games and you stop

noticing it and then everybody else

throws up when they play it yeah and

then you do a play test and then you do

a play test you're like oh that's cool

yeah and then and then you keep it and

you don't listen to anybody what anybody

say you should totally like don't don't

put things in your game that hurt people

physically other than that just just

keep adding it until you're out of money

yeah but how much uh like you just said

something really important where after a

while you're the one who designed it so

you don't really see things as well well

as people who haven't played yet yeah

what happens how do you I mean I know

you in our building and you invite

people in in your office and have have

and play has anything fun I mean does

does that have a fundamental impact on

on the game way I was at Brandon Chun

talk before this and he was saying like

you're super close to your game

especially with a small uh

team and it's super hard to look at it

objectively yeah um so you got other

people for that and when you're playing

your game that's I'm just copying his

words now like I copied patri Martin's

talk uh it's really easy um and he was

saying that um now I forgot what he said

actually um he he was saying that when

you're um playing your own game you're

kind of subconsciously avoiding bugs and

like oh yeah there's a problem here but

I'm going to ignore it and yeah this

game is a lot of fun and when someone

else plays it it might turn out they

have no clue how things work or they

totally break your game and it's not fun

for them so that's that weird thing

about games where like how does this

work where like you have this thing and

it doesn't mean anything you need this

person before it starts being something

and there are I don't know like how many

people are there on this planet like a

lot yeah and there's only one of you so

you have to make it the game for them I

guess guess like make the game you want

to make make it fun for you but test it

on them yeah and one of the reasons I

ask you to do this is because I noticed

when you were making Loof throwers you

were spending a lot of time getting the

actual last minute like how fast does it

go left right up down it has this really

it feels very easy it's not as easy as

it feels but it feels great to to to

steer the plane and you spend a lot of

time on that how much time did you spend

on that compared to like the rest of the

process like setting up the game like

there's two sides to that like with L

rers we set out out to make it a game

that feels great to play for everybody

like I give you the computer and you

launch and you start blowing up things

and you feel like oh yeah I'm the

coolest fighter pilot in the world and

that was the goal with that game but

you're a really bad player and your

score sucks but it still feels really

good for you yeah that that worked for

me really well my score sucked but I I

felt like I was really good that's fine

where whereas with superg great box we

had a fight about I said it's way too

hard it's way too hard you're was like

no no it's supposed to be this way yeah

like there's a difference between hard

and short games but that's a whole other

story okay um but

um the the the thing well oh yeah how

much time we how much time compared to

the setting the game up make our games

in a couple of days and then we spend

the year polishing them and that like we

have those basics in there if you look

at our very first prototype of luzes

it's pretty much the same game and it

just lacks a menu and then we spend a

year making a menu because that's no fun

at all like I want to make those effects

that's pretty much how it works and

during that year you have to make that

stupid menu um you spend a lot of time

tweaking the rest and it just keeps

changing and you try to make it feel as

good as it can for you like in a way I

guess the flamber games feel really good

to us mainly like it's kind of my idea

of what feels good like triple machine

guns and shooting lots of things that

flash when you hit them and and randomly

explode um and that's not for everybody

but at least it makes our game super

unique and that's I guess what you call

that flamb beer feel or whatever yeah

and do you think the platform has a lot

of impact on this like if you change

from a PC controlled game to say the

Vita or something the way of input

matters like this guy is using a a game

pad yeah and that changes that purple

arrow and the purple Arrow I don't know

um but it it feels different um but I

don't know other than that comp you guys

have have had other companies build

versions for you or other people um and

sometimes it doesn't really work out

like it it doesn't feel as good as the

original prototype like the original

radical fishing was made in game maker

and then Ramy ported it to flesh and I

still secretly think that the game maker

version is better okay so there's real

subtle things Ry messing up oh that's

Ramy yeah of course anybody else

questions about this yeah go ahead use

feedb like uh

um haptic feedback actually I have never

used that and I kind of wanted in I

think in Lu rer someone else did that um

but yeah that stuff is super cool but I

haven't really worked with it which is

super weird um yeah but I kind of want

to make a computer with a screen that

physically shakes would be cool okay

well we can do a play test with that I

can shake the screen for if you do that

we'll invite you back to uh expl about

that again yeah anybody yeah uh yes I

heard uh the screen shaking was a bug is

that true like what uh buck and Game

maker and uh friend of my

um teacher told me uh he worked with you

and um that the screen shaking was a bug

but you uh keep it in I don't I don't

know about that I've always like there's

this weird thing in in super low

resolution games where making a camera

follow something smoothly is really hard

so it kind of looks like it's shaking

but that's something we don't really

want like all this kind

of see the background color actually

changes but this kind of shake that's

all like hand coated and intentional uh

and it wasn't like an accident I don't

know who invented screen Shake but I

also would like to say that probably

every game would benefit from having

screen Shake even if you're like oh my

puzzle game doesn't need screen Shake

you're

wrong and explosions of course right

right here

yeah do you actually Market games uh

using the screen Shake is this very

prominent in everything you do and do

you put it forward when you release

something or is it something you let

players find out and have them just get

the game because of the gameplay well

the the thing with these things it is if

you just put them in the game and you

put the game out people will be like

yeah this game is fun and it feels good

but they don't know why and they don't

really care about it like if it's not

there they say hey this game sucks um if

it's there they just play and they're

happy and I guess what we do at V what

makes our games kind of different uh oh

I also added like a little clout when

you jump by the way um but what makes

our games kind of different to uh a lot

of other Studios is that we put a lot of

time into these things so we kind of

have to tell people that hey look at

that it it feels good that's the flamb

beer thing yeah marketing

um and Screen Shake is like a super

simple example of that because you I

just spent like 30 minutes just showing

tiny little things that I keep adding

and no player without seeing this

presentation is going to understand that

or feel it or well they feel it but

don't think about it and Screen Shake is

like the most most basic example that's

like the the the one great thing that's

the great thing of these things I don't

know I don't know how to how to say

words uh but screen Shake is like an

easy example of how to make games feel

good great yeah anybody

else no anything about Zambia or about

the Studio's next big secret Project X

or oh that's a good one yeah no no news

are you already working on something

actually we're we're having like super

big news tonight but I I don't think I'm

allowed to talk about that I see so so

keep keep your phones near or something

yeah okay

excellent D Willam thank you so much uh

a warm Applause for this

presentation

and one just one practical question how

did you manage to

skip between slides that you actually

play is this game maker running right

now yeah I programmed this whole

presentation from scratch all right very

nice you want to try it yes I would love

to let me let me put some meaning in

here here okay this is easy mode I'm

going to start the just press this

button that's all you need to do okay

hang on all right do you want me to hold

the microphone and you can tell them

about your feelings oh how I feel ah I

can see you're getting back at me oh

this is before he can die right so

that's kind of nice you press D you get

meaning oh D is meaning yeah okay that

means that if I don't oh my gosh how do

you feel about this that's very

meaningful how you feel about about

shooting those enemies before when they

couldn't even hurt you well it feels

more balanced now but don't you feel

like

guilt for killing them yeah how do you

restart uh you can press s s to reload

this thing okay so this whole

presentation is

available okay we were asking for it can

we go yeah can we go a few slides back

before you death press a a that goes

back so you can download this whole

presentation online uh and shoot things

as well

awesome it feels good right yeah it does

feel very good so so if you press D

again yeah then you go to like the

original version how are you how do you

feel now it's it's very lame

are you are you having fun do you see

promise in this prototype yes would you

like to fund it with the Dutch game

Garden Oh Absolut absolutely I would put

all my money into this cool yeah and um

what is it with zombies they're not

zombies oh okay that's why do you think

they're

zombies are you dodging my questions um

I'm I'm not very good at multitasking

but but um you can't die so oh that's

right I don't have to be afraid of these

guys but why do you why do you think

they're

zombies uh well maybe that's kind of a

cliche but I guess they're more like a

skeletal guy right yeah I don't know

little skulls maybe they're just wearing

musks and they're like trick or treat

did you actually have shooting

them did you actually have Paul Paul
