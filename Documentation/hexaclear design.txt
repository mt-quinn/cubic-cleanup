Hexaclear is a hex-based Blockudoku-like game where the player places pieces onto a hex-grid board. The board is made of seven hex flowers, each made of seven hexes. Every seven-hex straight line or pre-defined seven-hex flower that they fill is cleared and scored. Every line or flower scored is worth 10 points, with a 1.5x combo multiplier per unique clear in a single placement and a 1.1x streak multiplier for consecutive placement resulting in a clear. Streak and Combo multipliers stack with each other multiplicatively, but themselves additively. For example, clearing three in a single placement results in a combo of x2, not x2.25. Getting that same combo on a Streak of 1 results in a total multiplier of 2.2x, not 2.1. The player is given hands of three pieces at a time. Each piece is a random contiguous shape made of 1-4 hexes. The game is over when the player has no valid moves remaining with their current hand. 
Hexaclear is a web-based game optimized for mobile, with no scrolling, drag-and-drop of pieces, and excellent mobile UI.
